## ‚ú® Features

-   **Real-time Emotion Detection:** Analyzes your webcam feed to predict emotions in real-time.
-   **High Accuracy:** Powered by a pre-trained Swin Transformer model fine-tuned on the massive AffectNet dataset for superior performance on "in the wild" faces.
-   **Static Image & Video Analysis:** Upload your own images or videos for emotion prediction.
-   **Polished UI:** A professional and responsive user interface with an animated background, built with Gradio.
-   **Reproducible MLOps Pipeline:** The entire model training and data processing workflow is managed by DVC, ensuring 100% reproducibility.
-   **Containerized for Deployment:** The application is packaged with Docker for easy and consistent deployment anywhere.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.10+
-   Git and Git LFS ([installation guide](https://git-lfs.github.com))
-   An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA drivers is recommended for the training pipeline, but the deployed app runs on CPU.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Emotion-Recognition-MLOps.git
cd Emotion-Recognition-MLOps
